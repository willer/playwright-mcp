## Playwright MCP

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides browser automation capabilities using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev). This server enables LLMs to interact with web pages through structured accessibility snapshots, bypassing the need for screenshots or visually-tuned models.

### Development Guidelines

We enforce robust coding practices throughout the codebase through custom ESLint rules built around these principles:

1. **Robustness Over Workarounds**: Code must properly handle errors and corner cases
2. **Generic Over Specific**: Code should be configurable without hardcoded domains or services
3. **Test Integrity**: Tests must never be skipped or disabled - fix the underlying issue instead
4. **Clean Codebase**: No commented-out code, proper Promise handling, and consistent error handling

See [LINTER-RULES.md](utils/LINTER-RULES.md) for detailed explanation of all enforced rules.

To install the pre-commit hook that enforces these rules:
```bash
npm run install-hooks
```

To run the linter checks manually:
```bash
npm run lint        # Run all linting checks
npm run lint:fix    # Fix automatically fixable issues
npm run lint:code   # Run robust code quality checks
npm run lint:tests  # Run robust test quality checks
```

### Key Features

- **Fast and lightweight**: Uses Playwright's accessibility tree, not pixel-based input.
- **LLM-friendly**: No vision models needed, operates purely on structured data.
- **Deterministic tool application**: Avoids ambiguity common with screenshot-based approaches.

### Use Cases

- Web navigation and form-filling
- Data extraction from structured content
- Automated testing driven by LLMs
- General-purpose browser interaction for agents

### Example config

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```


#### Installation in VS Code

Install the Playwright MCP server in VS Code using one of these buttons:

<!--
// Generate using?:
const config = JSON.stringify({ name: 'playwright', command: 'npx', args: ["-y", "@playwright/mcp@latest"] });
const urlForWebsites = `vscode:mcp/install?${encodeURIComponent(config)}`;
// Github markdown does not allow linking to `vscode:` directly, so you can use our redirect:
const urlForGithub = `https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect?url=${encodeURIComponent(urlForWebsites)}`;
-->

[<img alt="Install in VS Code Insiders" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-VS_Code_Insiders?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=24bfa5">](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode-insiders%3Amcp%2Finstall%3F%257B%2522name%2522%253A%2522playwright%2522%252C%2522command%2522%253A%2522npx%2522%252C%2522args%2522%253A%255B%2522-y%2522%252C%2522%2540playwright%252Fmcp%2540latest%2522%255D%257D)

Alternatively, you can install the Playwright MCP server using the VS Code CLI:

```bash
# For VS Code
code --add-mcp '{"name":"playwright","command":"npx","args":["@playwright/mcp@latest"]}'
```

```bash
# For VS Code Insiders
code-insiders --add-mcp '{"name":"playwright","command":"npx","args":["@playwright/mcp@latest"]}'
```

After installation, the Playwright MCP server will be available for use with your GitHub Copilot agent in VS Code.

### User data directory

Playwright MCP will launch Chrome browser with the new profile, located at

```
- `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\ms-playwright\mcp-chrome-profile` on Windows
- `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/mcp-chrome-profile` on macOS
- `~/.cache/ms-playwright/mcp-chrome-profile` on Linux
```

All the logged in information will be stored in that profile, you can delete it between sessions if you'dlike to clear the offline state.


### Running headless browser (Browser without GUI).

This mode is useful for background or batch operations.

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--headless"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Running headed browser on Linux w/o DISPLAY

When running headed browser on system w/o display or from worker processes of the IDEs,
run the MCP server from environment with the DISPLAY and pass the `--port` flag to enable SSE transport.

```bash
npx @playwright/mcp@latest --port 8931
```

And then in MCP client config, set the `url` to the SSE endpoint:

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8931/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

### Tool Modes

The tools are available in two modes:

1. **Snapshot Mode** (default): Uses accessibility snapshots for better performance and reliability
2. **Vision Mode**: Uses screenshots for visual-based interactions

To use Vision Mode, add the `--vision` flag when starting the server:

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--vision"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Vision Mode works best with the computer use models that are able to interact with elements using
X Y coordinate space, based on the provided screenshot.

### Programmatic usage with custom transports

```js
import { createServer } from '@playwright/mcp';

// ...

const server = createServer({
  launchOptions: { headless: true }
});
transport = new SSEServerTransport("/messages", res);
server.connect(transport);
```
